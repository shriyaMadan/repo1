<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>Sofa was a small design-centered software company, founded by three guys who taught themselves how to code and make apps.<br>
Next to building and selling products, Sofa fueled its growth through design contracting work and quickly became known as a world-class design studio and software company. As our team and product portfolio grew, we moved away from contracting and focused fully on our own Mac, iOS and web products.
<br>Since 2011, our mission to create great experiences continues at Facebook â€“ now for millions of people at a time.</p>
<h4>KOEN BOK</h4>
<p>Koen started programming Python to enhance his video mixing sets. He has a keen eye for design and branding.</p>

<h4>DIRK STOOP</h4>
<p>Dirk is an interaction fanatic who likes to spit and polish. We also suspect he actually likes working on contracts.</p>

<h4>JASPER HAUSER</h4>
<p>Jasper is allergic to ugly. He has a background in visual arts and can snap his left eye on the pixel while designing.</p>

<h4>HUGO VAN HEUVEN</h4>
<p>When Hugo's not coding, designing or 3D modeling, he probably discovered something else that needs to be done.</p>

<h4>JORN VAN DIJK</h4>
<p>Jorn likes coming up with the big picture, then zooming in like there's no tomorrow. He'll push pixels 'til they're round.</p>

<h4>JOY-VINCENT NIEMANTSVERDRIET</h4>
<p>Whenever a mockup is just perfect, we give it to Joy and get it back better, much better.</p>

<h3>PARTNERSHIPS</h3>
<p>In 2007, Sofa and Acclivity entered into a joint venture around Checkout. After Sofa was acquired by Facebook,<a href="https://www.priority-software.com/us/?utm_source=acclivitysoftware"> Acclivity</a> took over both Checkout and Enstore.<br>
Sofa joined forces with <a href="http://picodev.com/">Pico</a> to create Versions. In 2010, shortly after Sofa developed Kaleidoscope, it acquired all of Versions. Both products are now further developed by <a href="https://blackpixel.com/">Black Pixel.</a></p>
